                                        <p class="text-lg-left sectionText">&emsp;The current dance world is increasingly evolving and incorporating adult ballet. Studios have been expanding their class offerings, and clothing and accessory companies have been adapting by creating special lines to meet this demand.</p>
                                        <p class="text-lg-left sectionText">&emsp;Adults seek ballet practice not only for its physical and mental health benefits but also as a form of leisure and social integration. This growth has also created space for those who began their studies as children or teenagers but did not pursue a professional dance career due to various reasons. These reasons include limited job opportunities, low wages, challenging aesthetic standards, injuries, and especially the age restrictions imposed in auditions.</p>
                                        <p class="text-lg-left sectionText">&emsp;With 30 years of experience and many comings and goings, we have observed a significant increase in the demand for adult ballet classes. In the past, when we stopped, there was no place to practice what our bodies were accustomed to. Nowadays, we can find some studios offering these opportunities, but something very special is still missing... THE STAGE. The space for these adult ballet lovers who, besides participating in classes, also dream of being on stage.</p>
                                        <p class="text-lg-left sectionText">&emsp;It is with this in mind that the Thalhe Festival was born. It aims to create an integrative and welcoming space for young adults, adults, and seniors who wish to experience being on stage and showcasing their art. Whether it is their first experience, their thousandth, or performing a style or variation they have always dreamed of. What we know as artists is that the stage is "the icing on the cake" for all the effort put into the classroom. At the Thalhe Festival, dancers will have the opportunity to experience everything a professional dancer does, including warm-up classes, physiotherapy sessions, rehearsal coaches, photo sessions, and more. </p>

Carving is a craft where the artisan uses tools, time, and dedication to transform raw wood into a specific shape or design. Drawing on this analogy, the founder of Grupo Thalhe believes that, just as wood can be carved and shaped, all bodies can be molded and refined through advanced techniques in classical ballet. This vision aims to create opportunities for children and young people who might have been overlooked due to not having the "ideal" body type, and to share this inclusive perspective with future generations.</p>
